# MediaReactive.js
MediaReactive is a JavaScript library that allows you to run functions or display/hide HTML elements based on specific media conditions. Create responsive and adaptive JavaScript code that adjusts to various devices and screen sizes.

## Key Features:

- **Media Detection**: MediaReactive can detect the user's media type (mobile, tablet, desktop, etc.) and adapt the JavaScript behavior accordingly.
- **HTML Element Control**: You can use custom attributes on HTML elements or call JavaScript functions to show or hide elements based on the media.
- **Custom Media Definitions**: In addition to the built-in media types like mobile, tablet, and desktop, you can also define your own custom media conditions through JavaScript.
- **Function Flexibility**: MediaReactive allows you to execute specific JavaScript functions only on the media you specify.
- **Easy Integration**: This library is designed to be easily integrated into your web projects, whether using script tags or module systems.

With MediaReactive, you can create more responsive and adaptive user experiences without having to write extensive CSS media queries or handle media detection manually.
